  <p>
    Welcome to the <strong>Central Digital Library</strong> — a nationwide initiative committed to preserving and promoting access to India's vast literary and academic heritage through digitization and technology integration. We believe in empowering every individual with the resources and tools to learn, grow, and explore knowledge, regardless of geographic or social barriers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our digital library is a hub of educational resources, rare manuscripts, research journals, historical archives, and public domain books. Whether you're a student, a researcher, or a curious learner, the Central Digital Library is designed to offer seamless access to learning materials across multiple subjects and languages.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>
    Our mission is to democratize access to information by:
    <ul>
      <li>Creating a unified digital repository of books, manuscripts, and reference material.</li>
      <li>Offering multilingual content to cater to India's diverse population.</li>
      <li>Integrating modern technology like AI search, Braille tools, and audio libraries.</li>
      <li>Collaborating with national and regional libraries to preserve cultural heritage.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Community & Outreach</h3>
  <p>

  </p>

  <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
  <p>
    In a rapidly digitizing world, knowledge preservation is more important than ever. Old manuscripts, rare books, and academic work are at risk of being forgotten or damaged. Our platform ensures that future generations can continue to learn from the wisdom of the past.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    We are more than a digital repository — we are a movement towards free, fair, and full access to knowledge for all.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
    Knowledge is a right, not a privilege. Let's unlock it together.
